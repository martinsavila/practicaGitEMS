# Serving Web Content


What you'll build
-----------------

This guide walks you through the process of creating a "hello world" web site with Spring. The service will accept HTTP GET requests at:

    http://localhost:8080/greeting

and respond with a web page displaying a greeting:

    "Hello, World!"

You can customize the greeting with an optional `name` parameter in the query string:

    http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=User

The `name` parameter value overrides the default value of "World" and is reflected in the response:

    "Hello, User!"


What you'll need
----------------

 - About 15 minutes
 - A favorite text editor or IDE
 - [JDK 6][jdk] or later
 - [Maven 3.0][mvn] or later

How to complete this guide
--------------------------

Like all Spring's [Getting Started guides](/guides/gs), you can start from scratch and complete each step, or you can bypass basic setup steps that are already familiar to you. Either way, you end up with working code.

To **start from scratch**, move on to [Set up the project](#scratch).

To **skip the basics**, do the following:

 - [Download][zip] and unzip the source repository for this guide, or clone it using [git](/understanding/git):
`git clone https://github.com/springframework-meta/gs-serving-web-content.git`
 - cd into `gs-serving-web-content/initial`.
 - Jump ahead to [Create a web controller](#initial).

**When you're finished**, you can check your results against the code in `gs-serving-web-content/complete`.

Set up the project
------------------

First you set up a basic build script. You can use any build system you like when building apps with Spring, but the code you need to work with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) and [Gradle](http://gradle.org) is included here. If you're not familiar with either, refer to [Building Java Projects with Maven](/guides/gs/maven/content) or [Building Java Projects with Gradle](/guides/gs/gradle/content).

### Create the directory structure

In a project directory of your choosing, create the following subdirectory structure; for example, with `mkdir -p src/main/java/hello` on *nix systems:

    └── src
        └── main
            └── java
                └── hello

### Create a Maven POM

`pom.xml`
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">

            <artifactId>thymeleaf-spring3</artifactId>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>

    <!-- TODO: remove once bootstrap goes GA -->
    <repositories>
        <repository>

            <snapshots><enabled>true</enabled></snapshots>
        </pluginRepository>
    </pluginRepositories>
</project>
```

TODO: mention that we're using Spring Bootstrap's [_starter POMs_](../gs-bootstrap-starter) here.

Note to experienced Maven users who are unaccustomed to using an external parent project: you can take it out later, it's just there to reduce the amount of code you have to write to get started.

Create a web controller
-----------------------

In Spring's approach to building web sites, HTTP requests are handled by a controller. You can easily identify these requests by the [`@Controller`] annotation. In the following example, the GreetingController handles GET requests for /greeting by returning the name of a [`View`], in this case, "greeting". A `View` is responsible for rendering the HTML content:

`src/main/java/hello/GreetingController.java`
```java
package hello;

import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.ui.Model;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;

@Controller
public class GreetingController {

    @RequestMapping("/greeting")
    public String greeting(@RequestParam(value="name", required=false, defaultValue="World") String name, Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("name", name);
        return "greeting";
    }

}
```

This controller is concise and simple, but there's plenty going on. Let's break it down step by step.

The `@RequestMapping` annotation ensures that HTTP requests to `/greeting` are mapped to the `greeting()` method.

> **Note:** The above example does not specify `GET` vs. `PUT`, `POST`, and so forth, because `@RequestMapping` maps all HTTP operations by default. Use `@RequestMapping(method=GET)` to narrow this mapping.

[`@RequestParam`] binds the value of the query String parameter `name` into the `name` parameter of the `greeting()` method. This query String parameter is not `required`; if it is absent in the request, the `defaultValue` of "World" is used. The value of the `name` parameter is added to a [`Model`] object, ultimately making it accessible to the view template.

The implementation of the method body relies on a view technology, in this case [Thymeleaf][u-thymeleaf], to perform server-side rendering of the HTML. Thymeleaf parses the `greeting.html` template below and evaluates the `th:text` expression to render the value of the `${name}` parameter that was set in the controller.

`src/main/resources/templates/greeting.html`
```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org">
<head> 
    <title>Getting Started: Serving Web Content</title> 
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" />
</head>
<body>
    <p th:text="'Hello, ' + ${name} + '!'" />
</body>
</html>
```


Make the application executable
-------------------------------

Although it is possible to package this service as a traditional [WAR][u-war] file for deployment to an external application server, the simpler approach demonstrated below creates a standalone application. You package everything in a single, executable JAR file, driven by a good old Java `main()` method. Along the way, you use Spring's support for embedding the [Tomcat][u-tomcat] servlet container as the HTTP runtime, instead of deploying to an external instance.

### Create an Application class

`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
```java
package hello;

import org.springframework.bootstrap.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.bootstrap.context.annotation.EnableAutoConfiguration;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.ComponentScan;

@ComponentScan
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }

}
```

The `main()` method defers to the [`SpringApplication`][] helper class, providing `Application.class` as an argument to its `run()` method. This tells Spring to read the annotation metadata from `Application` and to manage it as a component in the [Spring application context][u-application-context].

The [`@ComponentScan`][] annotation tells Spring to search recursively through the `hello` package and its children for classes marked directly or indirectly with Spring's [`@Component`][] annotation. This directive ensures that Spring finds and registers the `GreetingController`, because it is marked with [`@Controller`][], which in turn is a kind of [`@Component`][] annotation.

The [`@EnableAutoConfiguration`][] annotation switches on reasonable default behaviors based on the content of your classpath. For example, because the application depends on the embeddable version of Tomcat (tomcat-embed-core.jar), a Tomcat server is set up and configured with reasonable defaults on your behalf. And because the application also depends on Spring MVC (spring-webmvc.jar), a Spring MVC [`DispatcherServlet`][] is configured and registered for you — no `web.xml` necessary! Auto-configuration is a powerful, flexible mechanism. See the [API documentation][`@EnableAutoConfiguration`] for further details.

### Build an executable JAR

Now that your `Application` class is ready, you simply instruct the build system to create a single, executable jar containing everything. This makes it easy to ship, version, and deploy the service as an application throughout the development lifecycle, across different environments, and so forth.

Add the following configuration to your existing Maven POM:

`pom.xml`
```xml
    <properties>
        <start-class>hello.Application</start-class>
    </properties>

    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.springframework.zero</groupId>
                <artifactId>spring-package-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
```

The `start-class` property tells Maven to create a `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` file with a `Main-Class: hello.Application` entry. This entry enables you to run the jar with `java -jar`.

The [Spring Package maven plugin][spring-package-maven-plugin] collects all the jars on the classpath and builds a single "über-jar", which makes it more convenient to execute and transport your service.

Now run the following to produce a single executable JAR file containing all necessary dependency classes and resources:

```sh
$ mvn package
```

[spring-package-maven-plugin]: https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-zero/tree/master/spring-package-maven-plugin

> **Note:** The procedure above will create a runnable JAR. You can also opt to [build a classic WAR file](/guides/gs/convert-jar-to-war/content) instead.

Run the service
-------------------
Run your service with `java -jar` at the command line:

```sh
$ java -jar target/gs-serving-web-content-0.1.0.jar
```


Logging output is displayed. The service should be up and running within a few seconds.


Test the service
----------------

Now that the web site is running, visit <http://localhost:8080/greeting>, where you see:

    "Hello, World!"

Provide a `name` query string parameter with <http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=User>. Notice how the message changes from "Hello, World!" to "Hello, User!":

    "Hello, User!"

This change demonstrates that the [`@RequestParam`] arrangement in `GreetingController` is working as expected. The `name` parameter has been given a default value of "World", but can always be explicitly overridden through the query string.


Summary
-------

Congratulations! You have just developed a web page using Spring.
